# Hella Collection Cells

## Objectives

 1. Display a list using a `UICollectionView`
 2. Segue from a tapped cell to a detail view controller

## Instructions

 1. Drag a collection view (not a controller!) on to the existing view controller named, `HellaViewController`.
 2. Populate your collection view with 100 cells.
 3. If the index of the cell is included in the [Fibonacci Sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number), set the cell background color to purple. Otherwise set it to yellow.
 4. When a cell is tapped, it should take the user to a new view controller named `HellaDetailViewController`. The index number should be dislayed as a string of a label's text property. Additionally, the view's background color (not the label's) should be set to the corresponding color.
